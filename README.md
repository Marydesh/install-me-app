# Browser-Based Text Editor

App url - https://install-me-app.onrender.com

## Description

This project is a browser-based text editor designed to function as a single-page application (SPA) that meets the Progressive Web App (PWA) criteria. It implements various data persistence techniques to ensure reliability across different browsers and includes offline functionality. Built with an emphasis on usability and efficiency, this application allows developers to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection, ensuring their work can be reliably retrieved later.

Leveraging the `idb` package—a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API—this project demonstrates advanced data storage and retrieval techniques. This choice enables the application to offer robust offline data management, a crucial feature for modern web applications.
